# PSW Travel - Frontend
## Overview
PSW Travel is a web application designed to connect tour creators in Novi Sad with users interested in guided tours. The platform allows guides to create and publish tours, while users can purchase them and navigate through key locations using the app.

The frontend of the application is built using Angular and Angular Material to provide a seamless and modern user interface.

## My Contributions
During the development of the frontend, I worked on several key features, including:

+ Frontend for key point management – Implementing the user interface for adding key points to tours and managing the tour lifecycle.

+ Map integration – Together with Jana Janković and Duško Pilipović, I integrated maps into the application and enabled drawing a route that connects all key points of a tour.

+ Free Guided Tours feature –  Together with Jana Janković, I designed the user interface for displaying and allowing users to claim one free live tour, which is conducted with a guide in real-time.

+ Encounters module – Implementing the frontend for the Encounters module, allowing users to view, participate in, and interact with challenges of various types, including displaying them on the map.

+ UI/UX design – Utilizing Angular Material to create a professional and user-friendly interface, ensuring smooth interaction with the application.

## Technologies Used
The frontend of the application is built using:

+ Angular – Framework for building dynamic web applications.

+ Angular Material – Library for pre-designed UI components and styles.

+ Node.js – JavaScript runtime for building and running the application.

+ Angular CLI – Command-line interface for Angular project management.

## Setup Instructions
# Prerequisites
